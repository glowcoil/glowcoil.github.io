<p>the following is a video of a rotating cube:</p>

<p><video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/cube.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>this can be visualized as a plane sweeping through a cube of spacetime, or a flipbook:</p>

<p><video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/scan.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>if the plane is instead swept as follows:</p>

<p><video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/scan-sideways.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p>

<p>the resulting video is:</p>
