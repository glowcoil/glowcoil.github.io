the following is a video of a rotating cube:

<video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/cube.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

this can be visualized as a plane sweeping through a cube of spacetime, or a flipbook:

<video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/scan.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

if the plane is instead swept as follows:

<video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/scan-sideways.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

the resulting video is:

<video autoplay loop muted src="/posts/a-rotated-video-of-a-cube/cube-sideways.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
